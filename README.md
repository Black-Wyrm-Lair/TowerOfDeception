# Introduction
This mod is a slightly modified Tower of Deception D&D adventure originally created by Monte Cook for D&D website. I couldn't keep all aspects of the original adventure due to BG2 engine limits (e.g. non-existing creatures etc.), so I made my own little modified version. I liked this adventure, so I thought it could be a good idea to transform it into BG2:ToB engine.

# Compatibility
This mod is designed to work with Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal expansion pack with the latest patch - v26498 installed. There are currently no known incompatibilities. The mod has a WeiDU installer.

# Story
When Ustrain Yg'nuv, an evil githyanki wizard, built his tower on a rocky island amid the misty moors of Halron Bay, he had no idea that sailors would mistake the light of his magical Astral Shard at the top of his tower for the beacon of a lighthouse.
The light brought many sailors to an untimely doom. But Ustran did not care. He laughed at their plight and continued his nefarious work: using the power of the Astral Shard to kidnap creatures in the midst of teleporting and divert them to his lair.
One day, however, his own people appeared to drag the githyanki wizard back to his native Astral Plane. He's not been seen since.

But his tower remains. Not only does it continue to trick sailors on foggy nights (though most now have been warned by the legends of the "haunted lighthouse"), but the magic of the Astral Shard continues Ustrain's evil abduction scheme.
Originally, Ustrain enslaved or robbed the victims the Shard delivered to him. With the githyanki gone, now they remain trapped within the evil tower until they devise an escape or die.

You and your group are hired by a mage called Tian to go visit the tower and find something valuable for him, for a reasonable price, of course. Tian is located in The Crooked Crane Inn at City Gates. Go there, speak with him and adventure begins...

Recommended average party level is between 10 - 13. Also you should have some stronger weapons equipped, Lilalcor +3 is a good example. I don't recommend to play it on lower levels, as there are some monsters that can't be hit without weapons of at least +2 enchantment...
